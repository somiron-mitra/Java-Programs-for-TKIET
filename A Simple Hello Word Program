EXECUTION OF A JAVA PROGRAM   

Static loading:  A block of code would be loaded into the RAM before it executed ( i.e after being loaded into the RAM it may or may not get executed )

Dynamic loading:  A block of code would be loaded into the RAM only when it is required to be executed.

Note:  Static loading took place in the execution of structured programming languages. EX:  c- language

Java  follows the Dynamic loading

–     JVM would not convert all the statements of the class file into its executable code at a time.

–     Once the control comes out from the method, then it is deleted from the RAM and another method of exe type will be loaded as required.

–     Once the control comes out from the main ( ), the main ( ) method would also be deleted from the RAM. This is why we are not able to view the exe contents of a class file.


A Simple Hello Word Program

class HelloWorld
{
   public static void main(String args[])
   {
      System.out.println("Hello World");
   }
}
